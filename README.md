The 'Application infrastructure for the enterprise' library extends Asp.Net Core with functionality needed in medium to larger sized enterprise application.<br>
It consists of three parts. The [basic implementation](#mediator-pattern) provides a way of decoupling business functionality from infrastructural components (like controllers). This is done via a mediator pattern. The [Storage](#storage) projects offer an abstractions over various storage mechanims (i.e. in-memory, various orms, oodbs, etc.) With the [Modularity](#modularity) set of projects, the Asp.Net Core infrstructure is extened, in order to split the application into multiple modules, that are run in isolation and can communicate with the patterns defined in the basic implementation.
