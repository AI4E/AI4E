# AI4E
AI4E is short for "Application Infrastructure for the Enterprise".
It is a framework to implement medium to large scale enterprise applications with
Microsoft's Asp.Net Core stack and well-established techniques and patterns.  
It's goal is to provide an out of the box solution for various common use-cases.

The framework can be split into three major areas:
* A messaging system to allow communication between loosely coupled components
* The storage abstraction and based on that a zero-configuration system supports domain and model storage in a CQRS like fashion
* A module system to split the application into multiple small parts, based on the microservices concept

There are supporting and additional areas that extend the functionality. *TODO: Describe these or place a link to the respective wiki-page*

## Project goals
The project main goal is to deliver a high-level framework to easily build and maintain complex business applications in a modern, domain-driven and modular way. There is also the second goal to give advice and support in common situations learned from real-worl projects.

## Getting started

The current (pre-)release available via nuget is [0.2.0](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/AI4E).
*Please be aware that this is a prerelease and is not meant for production use.*

## Roadmap

Currently there is no release, so the goal is to build a stable, manufacturing ready release with the core features only.
