The 'Application Infrastructure for the Enterprise' library extends Asp.Net Core with functionality needed in medium to larger sized enterprise applications.<br>
It provides a messaging mechanism to decouple MVC-controllers that manage the views responsibilities from reusable application services. The integrated storage engine is built on top of modern application architecture like command query responsibility segration (CQRS), No-Sql and event-sourcing. With this in place a high level of persistence ignorance is achieved with the projects goal to completely decouple the domain model design from architectural and storage purposes. The library includes a modularity model that enables the application to be split into multiple modules (or microservices) that all run in isolation and are connected via the messaging mechanism.
